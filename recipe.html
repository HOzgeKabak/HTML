            Today we will talk about brownie, or brownie as we generally write it. 
            Because it contains less flour, its consistency is very different from the cakes and desserts we know. 
            The consistency of this delicious recipe, in which the taste of chocolate is clearly felt, is slightly moist.
            It does not leave a dry taste in your mouth while eating. The biggest mistakes made when making brownies are 
            adding too much flour and baking for a long time. Let us explain to you the tips and tricks of making a cake. 
            Bon appetit in advance!

            <li><strong>3</strong> eggs</li>
            <li><strong>300 grams</strong> of dark chocolate (coarsely chopped)</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> flour</li>
            <li><strong>150 grams</strong> of butter (10 tablespoons)</li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 style="background-color: brown; color: lightpink;" align="center">How to Make</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>As soon as it melts, remove it from the stove and add the chocolates you cut into pieces while the butter is still hot. Let the butter melt with the heat.</li>
            <li>Then set the butter chocolate mixture aside to cool at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Take the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar and beat well.</li>
            <li>Little by little, pour the butter-chocolate mixture onto the beaten sugar and eggs and continue mixing.</li>
            <li>After adding the whole mixture and mixing it, sift the flour and vanilla and add it on top.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, fold and mix the brownie mixture until all the ingredients are combined.</li>
            <li>Then, transfer the mixture you have prepared to a 20 cm square cake mold that has been greased or lined with baking paper. Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven without fan at 160 degrees for 30-35 minutes. When the top looks slightly cracked, remove it from the oven and let it rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Its consistency will improve as it rests. After resting, you can slice and serve. Enjoy your meal!</li>
        </ol>
